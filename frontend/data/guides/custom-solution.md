# Custom Solutions

One size does not fit all. We understand that every annotation project is different and that you might need a custom solution for your annotation project. Please see below, if our current solutions provide what you need. If not, please contact us through one of the options found [here](https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/en/institute/team/Schlechtweg-00003/).

## Annotator Selection

The first step in creating a successful annotation project is to select annotators, which fit your project. As a leading research university in machine learning in Europe, we understand the importance of annotation quality. Therefore, we offer a wide range of annotator selection options and have built-in quality control mechanisms. 

### Human Annotators

Currently we offer two ways to select human annotators for your project; either you select annotators from the [Human Annotator Pool](/pool/annotator) or you can create a [Job](/pool/joblisting) for your project. Jobs can either be open to be joined by anyone or have a waiting list, from which you can select annotators that requested to join your project.

### Computational Annotators

Computational annotators alleviate the need for human annotators, as they are able to annotate data automatically. Currently we offer just a basic computational annotator (a random annotator), but we are working on more advanced computational annotators. If you have a specific computational annotator in mind, please contact us. You can add these annotators from the [Computational Annotators Pool](/pool/annotator/computational) After adding a computational annotator to your project, you can select a phase in your project to run the annotator on. The annotator will then annotate all instances in that phase. 

## Annotation Tasks

We currently support the following annotation task types:

- [Lexical Substitution](/guide/explained-annotation-task-lexsub)
- [Usage Relatedness](/guide/explained-annotation-task-urel)
- [Word Sense Similarity](/guide/explained-annotation-task-wssim)

Note, that the annotation tasks are not limited to their original use case, as the platform was build to be as flexible as possible. If you have a specific annotation task in mind, which is not found above, please contact us.

## Use Cases

We want to streamline the platform to each users specific use case, such that the user is able to achieve their goals as efficiently as possible. Hence, we are currently working on a use case selection, which will allow you to select a use case for your profile and change the default behavior, look and feel of the platform to your use case. Right now, we are working on our first use case, which will aid the lexicographer. If you have a specific use case in mind, please contact us.
