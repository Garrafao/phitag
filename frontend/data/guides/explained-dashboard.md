# Explained: Dashboard

The dashboard is the first page you see when you log in to the platform and selected the default use case. If a different use case is selected, a specialized dashboard is shown.
It is a collection of all important functionality of the platform. The dashboard is divided into three sections: the project overview, the pool overview and the guide overview.

## Section: Project

The project section is divided into three tabs: "Create", "Public Projects" and "My Projects". 

- The "Create" tab redirects to the project creation page, where you can create a new project. 
- The "Public Projects" tab shows all public projects of the platform. 
- The "My Projects" tab shows all projects you are either a member of or the owner of.

## Section: Pool

The pool section is divided into four tabs: "Human Annotators", "Computational Annotators", "Corpus" and "Joblisting". 

- The "Human Annotators" tab shows all human annotators of the platform and allows you to add new annotators to your projects.
- The "Computational Annotators" tab shows all computational annotators of the platform and allows you to add new annotators to your projects. Computational annotators are used to automatically annotate data.
