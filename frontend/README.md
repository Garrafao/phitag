# Frontend Subdirectory

This directory contains the frontend for the application, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and serves as the frontend for the application, i.e. the user interface.
The basic structure of the frontend is loosly based on the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework (e.g. `pages`, `public` and `styles` directory).

## Overview

The structure of the frontend is as follows:

- `components`: Contains all the (reusable) components used in the frontend.
- `lib`: Contains the all the logic for the frontend, such as the API calls as found in subdirectory `service`, the data models as found in subdirectory `model` and the custom hooks as found in subdirectory `hooks`.
- `pages`: Contains all the pages of the frontend, which are the different views of the application. The pages are automatically generated by Next.js based on the files in this directory.
- `public`: Contains all the static files, such as images and fonts, that are used in the frontend.
- `styles`: Contains the styles for the frontend.

## Technologies

The frontend is built using the folowing tech-stack:

Main:
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): A framework based on React.js for building a full fledged frontend application.
    - [React.js](https://reactjs.org/): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework.

API:
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/): Promise based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js
- [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/): React Hooks library for remote data fetching.

Other:
- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/): Charting library.

Language:
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

## Getting Started

Using `yarn` (recommended) or `npm`, first install all the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install # or npm install
```

For the frontend to work, you also need to install the used fonts, which can be found [here (DM Mono)](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Mono), and place them in the `public/font/DMMono` directory.

Then, you can start the frontend in development mode by running the following command:

```bash
yarn dev # or npm run dev
```

Note, that for all features to work, you also need to start the backend (and hence the database).
