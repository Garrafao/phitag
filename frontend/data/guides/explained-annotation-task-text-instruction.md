# Text Instruction Annotation

## Introduction
In this task, you will be translating text snippets from English to German. Below is an example of such a text snippet and its translation:

| Text                                                                           |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| This veteran, the oldest pensioner in Great Britain, entered the army in 1758, and was severely wounded at the battle of Quebec under General Wolfe, in consequence of which he became an out-pensioner of Chelsea Hospital, and continued so for the period of seventy-five years. |

A possible translation of this text to German could be:

| Translation                                                                           |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dieser Veteran, der älteste Rentner Großbritanniens, trat 1758 in die Armee ein und wurde in der Schlacht von Quebec unter General Wolfe schwer verwundet. In der Folge wurde er Rentner des Chelsea Hospitals und blieb dies für die Dauer von fünfundsiebzig Jahren. |

## Guidelines for the Translation Task

### General Principles
- **Accuracy**: Ensure that the translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original text.
- **Clarity**: The translated text should be clear and easily understandable to native speakers of the target language.
- **Consistency**: Use consistent terminology and style throughout the translation.
- **Cultural Appropriateness**: Be aware of cultural differences and ensure that the translation is appropriate for the target audience.

### Specific Guidelines
1. **Translate the Meaning, Not Just the Words**: Focus on conveying the overall meaning of the text rather than translating word-for-word.
2. **Maintain the Original Tone and Style**: Preserve the tone (formal, informal, technical, etc.) and style of the original text.
3. **Handle Idiomatic Expressions Carefully**: Translate idiomatic expressions in a way that makes sense in the target language. If a direct translation does not exist, find an equivalent expression or explain the meaning.
4. **Proper Names and Titles**: Proper names, titles, and specific terms should generally be left in their original language unless there is a widely recognized equivalent in the target language.
5. **Numbers and Dates**: Follow the conventions of the target language for formatting numbers, dates, and other figures.
6. **Proofreading**: Review the translation for errors, consistency, and readability.
