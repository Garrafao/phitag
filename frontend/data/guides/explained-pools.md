# Explained: Pools

Pools are searchable collections of annotators, projects and jobs. 

## Pool: Annotators

Annotators are users that can be added to projects. They can be either human or computational annotators.

### Human Annotator Pool

The human annotator pool is a searchable collection of all human annotators of the platform. It allows you to add new annotators to your projects.

### Computational Annotator Pool

The computational annotator pool can be used to add computational annotators to your projects. Computational annotators are used to automatically annotate data.

## Pool: Projects

Projects are the main building blocks of the platform. See the [Explained: Projects](/guide/explained-project) guide for more information.

### Project Pool

The project pool contains all projects of the platform. 

### Personal Pool

The personal pool contains all projects you are either a member of or the owner of.

## Pool: Jobs

Jobs are a collection of projects that are looking for annotators. Jobs can either be open to be joined by anyone or have a waiting list. Here you can also create your own job listing for your own projects.
