## Overview

This guide provides detailed steps on seamlessly integrating Prolific with PhiTag to streamline the process of publishing your study and hiring annotators. Below, you'll find essential details to successfully publish your project on the Prolific platform and engage annotators efficiently.

## Requirement 
You must have an acount in both Prolifc and PhiTag. If you don't have [researcher account](https://app.prolific.com/register/researcher/email) in prolific, please  [create](https://app.prolific.com/register/researcher/email) first. Please read the ["Setting up a study on Prolific guide"](https://researcher-help.prolific.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360009220953-Setting-up-a-study-on-Prolific-step-by-step-guide?_gl=1*1tt5vbb*_gcl_au*MTg4NTM2NzUzNS4xNjk2MTQ4ODM0).
## Step 1: Create Project

Refer to this [guide on creating a project](/guide/explained-project) in Phitag to initiate the first step of integrating Prolific.


## Step 2: Create Phase

Follow this [guide on creating a phase](/guide/explained-phase) in Phitag to set up the necessary phases for your project.


## Step 3: Create Joblisiting
Once your [project](/guide/explained-project) and [phase](/guide/explained-phase) are set up, proceed to create a job listing associated with the corresponding project and phase. After job listing creation, locate the copy link icon on the top right of the card. This link is crucial and needs to be pasted in your Prolific project creation page.

## Step 4: Paste the link in Prolific and copy the completion Code

Having created your project and phase, the next step is to paste the copied link into Prolific. Find the card for your created job listing, and click on the copy link icon. Paste this link in the "What is the URL of your study?" section on Prolific. Additionally, copy the study completion code from the available options, as PhiTag supports both code formats.

## Step 5: Paste the completion code to PhiTag

## What annotators will see?
Once participants click on the provided link within their Prolific account, they will be redirected to Phitag and presented with two options: "I am new to Phitag" and "I have already registered". Note: Registration in Phitag is mandatory to participate in the study. For users who are already registered, they should proceed by selecting "I have already registered," leading them to the login page where they need to provide their username and password. Upon successful login, users will be redirected to the study page. If not registered, they should click on "I am new to Phitag" which will lead them to the registration page. Here, users must provide their valid Prolific ID during the registration process. After registration, users can access the study page.
